# SFML-Game
## Assignment Details

Required:

Use C++ and SFML to create an original single player 2D game.  The theme of the project is “Out of Control”.  The game’s mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics are completely up to you.  Feel free to use third party assets, but ensure that you give credit to the developer or licence holder in your documentation.  The game should feature a player,  pickups, camera, HUD, collision detection and enemies (if relevant).  Classes should reside in their own cpp files with corresponding header files.  Ensure that all code is formatted and commented where relevant.  Marks will be awarded for use of advanced C++ concepts such as references, pointers and memory management.  Marks will also be awarded for innovation, scope, completeness and code layout.  Develop your project in Xcode or Visual Studio.  Zip your entire project before uploading.

Use Rogers’s ’10-pager’ design document to create a high-level GDD for your game.  A sample document and discussion of the sample are available here and here.

Provide a link to YouTube video of a playthrough (not a trailer) of your game.  Use OBS,  screencast-o-matic.com, Camtasia or similar to record your playthrough session.  Provide audio narration throughout, drawing attention to innovation and complexity.

 Three uploads are therefore required:

Zipped project
A Word file containing your design document
A Word file containing a link to your YouTube video
This project is worth 50 marks.  Marking template available here.

Late submissions will be penalised at a rate of 5% per day.
